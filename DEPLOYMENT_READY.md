## 🔧 Technical Details

### Python Configuration:
```python
# app.py now supports:
port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))  # Railway provides PORT
host = os.environ.get('HOST', '0.0.0.0')  # Bind to all interfaces
app.run(host=host, port=port)
```

### NLTK Data Configuration:
```python
# Configured for Railway's temp directory
nltk_data_path = os.environ.get('NLTK_DATA', '/tmp/nltk_data')
nltk.data.path.append(nltk_data_path)
```

### Gunicorn Configuration (Procfile):
```
web: gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 4 --timeout 120
```
- **Workers:** 4 (adjustable based on traffic)
- **Timeout:** 120 seconds (for NLTK initialization)
- **Binding:** Dynamic port from Railway

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/health
```

Expected:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "AgriConnect AI - Farmer Sentiment Analysis",
  "version": "2.0.0"
}
```

### 2. Web Interface
Visit: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/`
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Animated particles background
- Real-time sentiment analysis

### 3. API Test
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/analyze-sentiment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "The crop yield exceeded expectations this year!"}'
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance:
- **Cold Start:** 3-5 seconds (first request)
- **Warm Response:** 100-200ms
- **API Latency:** 50-150ms
- **NLTK Analysis:** 10-50ms

### Optimization Tips:
1. Keep at least 1 request/hour to prevent cold starts
2. Use Railway's metrics to monitor performance
3. Adjust Gunicorn workers based on traffic
4. Consider caching for repeated queries

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Cost Optimization:
1. **Railway Free Tier:**
   - $5 credit/month
   - Covers ~10,000-20,000 requests
   - Perfect for demos and MVPs

2. **Optimize Resource Usage:**
   - Start with 2 Gunicorn workers
   - Monitor Railway metrics
   - Scale up only when needed

3. **Prevent Cold Starts:**
   - Set up health check pings
   - Keep 1 request every 30 minutes
   - Use Railway's built-in monitoring

### Performance Tips:
1. **NLTK Data:**
   - Pre-downloaded during build
   - Cached in `/tmp/nltk_data`
   - Loads once per worker

2. **Gunicorn Workers:**
   - Start with 4 workers
   - Formula: `(2 x CPU cores) + 1`
   - Monitor CPU usage in Railway

3. **Response Time:**
   - First request: ~3-5s (NLTK loading)
   - Subsequent: ~100-200ms
   - Consider warming up on deploy

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions:

#### 1. Build Fails on Railway
```bash
# Check: requirements.txt has gunicorn
grep gunicorn requirements.txt

# Should show: gunicorn==21.2.0
```

#### 2. NLTK Data Not Found
```bash
# Check: nixpacks.toml has NLTK download
# Should include:
python -m nltk.downloader -d /tmp/nltk_data vader_lexicon punkt stopwords wordnet
```

#### 3. App Crashes on Start
```python
# Check: app.py uses environment PORT
port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
```

#### 4. Static Assets Not Loading
```html
<!-- In index.html, use CDN for Tailwind (current setup) -->
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
<!-- Or build static CSS for production -->
```
